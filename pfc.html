<h1>pfc - The Port Forwarding Compressor</h1>

<code>pfc</code> is a small program designed to establish compressed
TCP connections between machines.  Two copies of <code>pfc</code> talk
to each other with a with a simple compressed protocol.  This provides
for a simple means to compress typical TCP protocols such as POP, IMAP
or NNTP.  It comes in handy when you're connecting over a modem, or
even a WAN.  It works both under Unix and Win32.<p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<code>pfc</code> is alpha software.  It has worked for me for over a
year, but I don't consider it feature complete.  It lacks decent
documentation, a few features, and polish.

<h2>Download</h2>

The source distribution of <code>pfc</code> is available here: <a
href="pfc-0.8.tar.gz">pfc-0.8.tar.gz</a>.<p>

The Win32 executable is available here: <a href="pfc.exe">pfc.exe</a>.<p>

If you want to build the Win32 executable yourself, you can download
the source and read the INSTALL for instructions (the steps are
non-trivial).<p>

For the curious, the main source file <code>pfc.c</code> <a href="pfc.c">is
here</a>.</p>
